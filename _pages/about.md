I am currently an MPhil student at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). I am a member of The Deep Interdisciplinary Intelligence Team (DiÂ² Team), under the supervision of Professor [Yuetao Yue](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/YUE-Yutao/yutaoyue). My research interests focus on Large Language Models (LLM), particularly in multimodal LLMs and reasoning enhancement in LLMs. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Science in 2024 at [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](xjtlu.edu.cn), majoring in Financial Mathematics.
