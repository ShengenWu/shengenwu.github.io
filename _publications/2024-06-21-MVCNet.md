excerpt: 'In medical imaging datasets, the high cost of annotation and incomplete coverage of disease categories are significant challenges. Multi-Label Generalized Zero Shot Learning (ML-G ZSL) holds promise for alleviating these issues in medical practice. ML-GZSL techniques can predict a variety of seen and unseen disease classes by learning the visual and semantic information of seen classes. Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has demonstrated considerable potential due to its structural similarity to Transformers. When ViT is used in conjunction with Transformers, it can generate better visual features and label embeddings. Inspired by these facts, we propose a ViT-based medical image ML-GZSL network, MVCNet.'
